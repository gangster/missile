## What is a Missile?

A Missile is a single purpose object for giving you a sane, object-oriented place to put domain logic in your Ruby applications.  It represents a *single* concept/behavior in your domain.   It is a Command/Interactor hybrid with friendly and flexible APIs.   It succeeds in simplifying both models and controllers by eliminating callbacks in the former, and conditionals in the latter.
